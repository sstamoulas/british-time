We use this information (including the information collected by our third-party service providers) for analytics (including to determine which portions of the Services are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Services), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><span style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies</span>.

We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
    <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash cookies") to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation.

If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services, because the Services may not function properly. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

    <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the “Information we collect automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive.

We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style={{ color: '#0000ff' }}>Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</span></a>.</p>

    <p>We may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technologies, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's (“NAI”) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style={{ color: '#0000ff' }}>Consumer Opt-Out Link</span></a> and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style={{ color: '#0000ff' }}>Consumer Opt-Out Link</span></a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.

      <li style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Our Legal Bases for Use of Your Information</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing of your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>

      <li>With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.</li>
      <li>Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.</li>
      <li>Legal Compliance: We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>

By using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union, United Kingdom, or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at support@nativetalk.live. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. If you have an online account with us, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request, although we may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.</p>
    <p>You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
    <p>The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information, including opting out of the “sale” of their personal information.&nbsp; <span style={{ color: '#3d3c40' }}>Although we do not believe we engage in the sale of personal information (and have not in the past twelve months) as we currently understand such term to be defined under applicable law and relevant regulatory guidance, we do share information as described in this Policy, including with certain analytics and advertising partners who perform certain services like analyzing our Services and showing you ads for Native Talk.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Depending on how you use the Services, we may share the following categories of information with <span style={{ color: '#3d3c40' }}>analytics and advertising partners</span>: identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; and inference data. If you would like to opt out of Native Talk's use of your information for such purposes, you may do so by opting out as set forth above in the section on <a href="#online-analytics">Online Analytics &amp; Advertising</a>.</p>
    <p><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>California Do-Not Track Disclosure</span></p>
    <p>Native Talk is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes. That is why we have provided links (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google opt-out link. However, Native Talk does not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>
    <p><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>California Shine the Light Disclosure:</span></p>
    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Native Talk who are California residents to request certain information, once per year, regarding our disclosure of their personal information (as defined by California law) to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, or in the alternative, that we provide a cost-free means for consumers to opt out of any such sharing. We do not currently share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
